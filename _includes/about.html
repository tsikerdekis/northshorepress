        <p>Northshore Press began as a publishing company focused primarily on books. In 2025, following a major restructuring, the company expanded its mission to include a broader spectrum of media, embracing digital content, games, and interactive storytelling alongside its literary roots.</p>
        <p>Driven by a passion for meaningful content, we continue to publish fiction, nonfiction, and technical works while exploring new formats and platforms.</p>
